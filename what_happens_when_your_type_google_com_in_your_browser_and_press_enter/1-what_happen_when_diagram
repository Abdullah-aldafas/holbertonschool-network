1. DNS resolution  
   - The browser asks the local DNS resolver for the IP of www.google.com.  
   - The resolver queries the DNS hierarchy (root, TLD, authoritative DNS).  
   - The authoritative DNS server returns the public IP address of www.google.com
     to the local DNS resolver, which sends it back to the client.

2. Encrypted connection to the server IP and port  
   - Using the resolved IP address, the client opens a TCP connection to the
     server on port 443 (HTTPS).  
   - A TLS handshake takes place between the client and the server so that the
     traffic will be encrypted.

3. Traffic passing through the firewall  
   - The encrypted packets travel through the user’s router, ISP and then
     reach Google’s edge network.  
   - An edge firewall inspects the traffic and allows the HTTPS request on
     port 443 to enter the infrastructure.

4. Load balancer distribution  
   - After the firewall, the request goes to a load balancer.  
   - The load balancer distributes incoming HTTPS requests across several
     backend web servers to balance the load and increase availability.

5. Web server handling the HTTP request  
   - The selected web server terminates TLS (decrypts the traffic) and reads
     the HTTP GET request for https://www.google.com.  
   - The web server forwards the request to an application server.

6. Application server generating the web page  
   - The application server runs the application logic that decides what
     content should be shown on the Google home page for this user.  
   - To build the response, it may need data from a database.

7. Database query  
   - The application server sends a query to a database server (for example to
     read configuration, user-specific data, or localization data).  
   - The database returns the requested data to the application server.

8. Response back to the client  
   - The application server generates the final HTML for the page and sends it
     back to the web server.  
   - The web server sends the HTTP response over the existing TLS connection
     back through the load balancer, firewall, ISP and router to the client.  
   - The browser receives the encrypted response, decrypts it via TLS, parses
     the HTML/CSS/JS and renders the Google home page on the screen.
